# Overview

This repository exists to share GitHub templates and configuration with other
repositories within the the [`Common Knowledge`](https://github.com/commonknowledge)
organization.

**This repository is public**. It needs to be public for other repositories to
be able to leverage the templates that it provides.

The approach was taken from
[this help page](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-default-community-health-file) via [Chromatic HQ](https://chromatichq.com/insights/sharing-github-issue-pull-request-templates).
